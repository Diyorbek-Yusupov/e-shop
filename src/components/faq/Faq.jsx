                  I have heat mats and artificial light. I planted them in all
                  purpose potting soil. Moist not wet. Placed them on a heat
                  mat. If not available, somewhere where it's 72 degrees. Add
                  natural light, but I used artificial light. Takes 10- 15 days
                  because of there hard shell on the seed.
